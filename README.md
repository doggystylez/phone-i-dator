very nice

the node was bootstrapped by state syncing on another server. the phone doesn't have enough ram to restore a snapshot from state sync itself

## starting the node as a validator

## fully synced and participating in consensus

missed 113 blocks in the migration. this node is participating in the bitsong delegation program so its uptime is being monitored. it will have to have a 98% or higher uptime to qualify. 99.8%+ over the monitered period should be achievable. 

got some spam while freeing up disk space. the entire .bitsongd dir, including the chain state just after state sync, was 148MB(!) compressed
